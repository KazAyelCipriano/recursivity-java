# Recursion Efficiency Testing

This repository is dedicated to evaluating the efficiency of different recursion techniques implemented in Java. It provides a set of Java programs that test and compare the performance of various recursion strategies across multiple scenarios.

## Features
- **Implementation of Multiple Recursion Techniques**: Includes examples such as tail recursion, head recursion, and divide-and-conquer recursion.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures execution time and memory usage to compare the efficiency of each technique.
- **Test Scenarios**: Includes both computational and combinatorial problems (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, factorial calculation, and more).

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or higher is recommended.
- **IDE/Text Editor**: Any Java-compatible IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recursion-efficiency-testing.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd recursion-efficiency-testing
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

## Usage
1. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
   ```
2. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   java src.Main
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to select a recursion technique and test scenario.

## File Structure
- `src/`
  - Contains all the Java source code files.
- `tests/`
  - Includes sample test cases for validating the implementations.
- `README.md`
  - Project documentation (this file).
